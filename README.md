# Background

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Whats in here?
This assignment has several folders:

The main directory has the samples.json which has a copy of the data from the url (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json).
The main directory also has the index.html folder which has the structure of the the app.  The images folder holds several snap shots of my Dashboard that I have then used in my readme.  

The static/js/app.js holds my javascript which took the samples.json and the index.html and made a functional Dashboard.

My app was also deployed to github pages! see below for the link:

# Dashboard
<br>
There is a drop down that will update every chart and table to the test subjects ID number.

<br>
Horizontal bar graph that shows the top ten OTUs and their values.

<br>
Bubble Graph that has a better representation of the top ten OTUs that were found in the patients belly buttons.  The larger the circle, the greater the OTU value was.

<br>
There is also a belly button wash guage that shows the frequency every week that each patient was instructed to wash their belly buttons.

Final findings:

It appears that the greater the frequency of washings occurs the less bacteria is present.  However, there is a larger frequency of the bacteria that survives.  This is probably due to not having to compete for resources since most of the bacteria has been eliminated.
